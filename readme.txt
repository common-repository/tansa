== Description ==
* Write to a higher standard
Tansa is an advanced text proofing system that can check thousands of words per second.
Not only will it correct nearly all spelling, style, punctuation and hyphenation errors, it also ensures that everyone in your organization follows the same set of rules.

* Everywhere you need it
Tansa is a flexible solution that works in the most popular text editing applications, web platforms and page layout software.

* Custom dictionaries
Your dictionaries can be adapted to suit your organization perfectly. We can help customize your solution by analyzing a large volume of your company's published text.

* Save time and money
Our customers have documented dramatic increases in productivity, reducing copy editing time by as much as 40 percent and drastically reducing published errors.

* Improve readability
Tansa can identify the number or length of characters, words, sentences and syllables to ensure Plain Language guidelines are achieved. Tansa´s readability score is based on several indexes, including Flesch-Kincaid, Dale-Chall and SMOG.

* Write with variety and precision
Tansa will suggest synonyms where there is more than one option. Synonyms develop your writing by giving you a more varied and richer vocabulary.

* Make your own adjustments
The Tansa Web Admin is designed to work as both an interactive tool to direct Tansa´s proofing engine and as a searchable style guide. The type of permissions given to users are based on the users´ roles. Administrators will be able to edit and manage entries, while the majority of users will only be given permission to view entries and make suggestions.

* A multi-lingual solution
Our solutions are available in more than a dozen languages. Multiple languages can be supported on a single server which makes it easier for our customers to distribute the solution to offices around the world. 

* Integrated and customized for your tools
Tansa´s APIs allow customers to drop our proofing client into almost any editorial system, proprietary or out of the box. This creates a centralized editing solution, whether your users are working in Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign or your own custom-developed web CMS.

* Tansa learns from your mistakes
Machine learning is actively used to improve our solution. Every time you run content through Tansa, the system keeps track of every error that is found, corrected or ignored. This statistical data is used to improve the system's proofing results.

* Customers worldwide uses Tansa
More than 150k writers, editors and page designers around the world use Tansa on a daily basis to improve their editorial workflow.


== Installation ==

1. After installing and activating the Tansa plugin, your users can access Tansa this way:

	**For WordPress 5 and higher, with the Gutenberg editor:**
	* There will be a red Tansa button inside the WordPress Settings menu (click the three vertical dots in the top right corner). This will open the Tansa pane. For easier access going forward, the user can make Tansa a favorite plugin, by clicking the Star icon in the top of the Tansa pane. This will create a red Tansa button on the WordPress toolbar.
	
	**For WordPress 4, with the TinyMCE editor:**
	* There will be a red Tansa button in the toolbar above the text editing area.
	
2. Once the Tansa plugin is installed and activated, you will see the "Tansa Settings" menu in the main menu section, where you can preconfigure the Tansa "Server URL" and "License Key" for all your users.
   For more information on how set the Server URL and License Key, please see the screenshot section.

== How to use? ==
Clicking the Tansa button gives a menu with the proofing options available to that user. Clicking one of the proofing options will make Tansa scan the whole or selected text and provide the finds in a user interface to the user, so the user can decide what changes should be done to the text.
